## üöÄÔ∏è Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a running node.

_Prerequisites:_

Linux systems:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
java -jar node/target/waves-all*.jar path/to/config/waves-{network}.conf
```

Mac systems (assuming already installed homebrew):

```bash
brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
java -jar node/target/waves-all*.jar path/to/config/waves-{network}.conf
```

Windows systems (assuming already installed OpenJDK 8):

```bash
java -jar node/target/waves-all*.jar path/to/config/waves-{network}.conf
```

The node can be built and installed wherever Java can run.
To build and test this project, you will have to follow these steps:

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

_1. Setup the environment._

- Install Java for your platform:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre                     # Ubuntu
# or
# brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8 # Mac
```

- Install SBT (Scala Build Tool)

_2. Clone this repo_

```bash
cd Waves Pizza
```

_3. Compile and run tests_

```bash
sbt checkPR
```

_4. Run integration tests (optional)_

Create a Docker image before you run any test:

```bash
sbt node-it/docker
```

- Run all tests. You can increase or decrease number of parallel running tests by changing `waves.it.max-parallel-suites`
  system property:

```bash
sbt -Dwaves.it.max-parallel-suites=1 node-it/test
```

- Run one test:

```bash
sbt node-it/testOnly *.TestClassName
# or
# bash node-it/testOnly full.package.TestClassName
```

_5. Build packages_

```bash
sbt packageAll                   # Mainnet
sbt -Dnetwork=testnet packageAll # Testnet
```

`sbt packageAll` ‚Äåproduces only `deb` package along with a fat `jar`.

_6. Install DEB package_

`deb` package is located in target folder. You can replace '\*' with actual package name:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i node/target/*.deb
```

_7. Run an extension project locally during development (optional)_

```bash
sbt "extension-module/run /path/to/configuration"
```

_8. Configure IntelliJ IDEA (optional)_

The majority of contributors to this project use IntelliJ IDEA for development, if you want to use it as well please follow these steps:

1. Click `Add configuration` (or `Edit configurations...`).
2. Click `+` to add a new configuration, choose `Application`.
3. Specify:
   - Main class: `com.wavesplatform.Application`
   - Program arguments: `/path/to/configuration`
   - Use classpath of module: `extension-module`
4. Click `OK`.
5. Run this configuration.
